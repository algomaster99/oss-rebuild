Difference: due to different build environments.
Built-By: This attribute identifies the user who ran the build. It differs here because the builds were executed by different users (runner vs. aman).
Attributes that can have a similar fix: Built-By, Signed JARs, Os-Version, Eclipse Properties


Fix: Remove this attribute from the MANIFEST.MF file.

Difference: due to how rebuild process is configured.
Created-By: This attribute identifies the specific tool that produced the JAR. It differs because different versions of Apache Maven were used (3.8.8 vs. 3.6.3).

Fix: Ensure the exact same build tool and version are used for the original build and any subsequent rebuild.

DIfference: The classfiles are signed so they are different between builds.

DIfference: The properties `m2e` are created by the built-in version of Maven in Eclipse IDE.
Fix: Replacing the build environment with Eclipse IDE seems a cumbersome fix.
It is better to remove attributes related to eclipse as build manifests don't have an impact semantically.

Difference is due to dynamicity of the above property which means the value is not fixed as the branch ref is mutable.

Fix: Simply remove this attribute out of the MANIFEST.
